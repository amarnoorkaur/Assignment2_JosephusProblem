Reference:
Numberphile. (2016, October 28). The Josephus Problem - Numberphile [Video]. YouTube. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCsD3ZGzMgE  --> inference from the video and research:
1) All the even one's are killed first
2) The last person to survive is always odd

OUTPUTS:
(n) --> winner
1 --> 1
2 --> 1
3 --> 3
4 --> 1
5 --> 3
6 --> 5
7 --> 7
8 --> 1
9 --> 3 
10 --> 5
11 --> 7
12--> 9
13 --> 11

Observation:
1) Powers of 2 give 1 as the last person who survived
if n = (2)^a
then winner is the first person
2) For the numbers between the powers of 2 the output increases by 2 until it reaches the next power of 2 where it resets to 1 again

Guess for the outputs based on our observation for 1 to 13 inputs:
let's take 79 as input and try to make an educated guess for this number:
79 = 64 + 8 +4+2+1
   = 2^6 +15
for 2^6 the output will be 1 
for 15
15 = 8+7
   = 2^3 +7
=> after l steps it's the turn of 2l + 1 and after l steps, there are a power of two number of people left, then the first person who kills is going to be the person who survives and is the winner 


example 2 )
if 41 people
41 = 32 +9
so 9*2+1 = 19
so the 19th person is  going to be the winner


The winner can also be found using binary:(GeeksforGeeks. (2022, November 15). Josephus problem using bit magic. GeeksforGeeks. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/josephus-problem-using-bit-magic/)
=> shift the leftmost digit to the right end and convert it into the decimal number, that number is the answer
